    <h1>Paris</h1>
    <p>
        Paris is France's capital, renowned for art, 
        fashion, and gastronomy, nicknamed the "City of Light". 
        Its history dates back to a Celtic tribe, the Parisii, 
        around 259 BC, before becoming the Roman city Lutetia 
        and later changing to Paris in the 4th century. The city 
        is a global center of culture and finance, featuring 
        iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and home to 
        world-class museums such as the Louvre.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Paris became a major center of culture and business in Western Europe
         and is known as the "City of Light" (La Ville Lumière).
