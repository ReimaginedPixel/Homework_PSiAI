    <h1>Poland</h1>
    <p>
        Poland, a nation with a tumultuous yet 
        resilient history, emerged in the 10th 
        century under Mieszko I and later experienced 
        a "Golden Age" of growth before facing centuries 
        of partitions by neighboring powers. The nation 
        was reborn in 1918 but was again devastated by 
        the Nazi invasion in 1939, marking the start of 
        World War II and leading to millions of Polish 
        deaths and eventual rule under the communist 
        Soviet Union. However, in 1989, the Solidarity 
        movement helped overthrow communism, ushering 
        in a new era of democracy and a dynamic, market-based 
        economy in modern Poland.
